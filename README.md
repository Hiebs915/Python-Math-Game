# Math Game Website :woman_teacher:
This repo contains Python code for a simple math game and a Django folder to host the code.  The goal is to create a website that hots a simple math game for Mary's 3rd grade students.  The website will allow them to login, play the game, and see their stats.  The front- and back-end of the website will be handled by Django.

## Installation
```bash
pip install django # You will need Django for the web development part of this project
```

## Usage

```python
import random
from random import choice

random.randint(0,12) # Returns a random number between 0 and 12
random.choice([func1,func2,func3]) # Returns a random element from a non-empty sequence item from a list, set, tuple, or dictionary

```
